# Portfolio-Assignment

## Overview of Assignment

For this Assignment, we were requested to create our own web page for our portfolio. We needed to ensure that the layout was responsive and adapts to any viewport. The webpage needed to have functional links to external webpages and also link the navigation bar to it's corresponding sections on the web page.

Before creating my portfoilio web page, I created a wireframe so I could figure out how I wanted my website to lay out. This helps me to understand the type of styling I need to use for each selector. See below.

After building my wireframe, I began my html file. Adding all the elements I needed to build the basis of my website. I used the bootstrap framework to help with styling the web page.

After this I created my CSS file and a JS file, so I could add additional styling for the webpage and add some functions.

In then end, all files came together to produce a fully functioning website, where the user can get an overview on what portfolio entails and links to all outside sources and websites.
